            Hi there! My name is Amber and I would like to thank for taking you for the time to read about my weight loss journey 
        </h1>
        <p>
            Let me start off by saying, I’m not a normal person, I can be weird, a nerd, and be a complete mess sometimes, but stick with me and help motivate me to keep going!! I can, I will!! I saw that saying on Tik Tok awhile back and it stuck. With that being said,
        </p>
        <h2>
            Here we go!!

            I started this back in July, but I am now talking openly about it. In the beginning, I starved myself to shrink my stomach so I could lower my portion sizes.  I lost 81 pounds in a matter of months. It was NOT healthy at all. Now, I am trying to do this the right way. I was a size 22 back in July, I am now fitting in some clothes a size 8! I need to get a measuring tape to record this as well. I will post pictures along the way, as best I can. I am married and have 3 kids. My boys take a lot of my time, especially during the holidays. I started a 50 squat a day challenge for the month of December. I do my squats when I fill my water jug up during the day! I fill it up usually 3-4 times a day!

        <h3>
            I will start with today. 
        </h3>

            <li>10 minutes arm workout</li>
            <li>50 jumping jacks</li>
            <li>4 minuntes jumping on the trampoline</li>
            <li>1 minute plank</li>
            <li>50 behind the arm pull?</li>
            <li>30 second arm lifts</li>
            <li>100 crunches</li>
            <li>100 sit-ups</li>
                
        </ul>

            I feel so great after working out. I don’t constantly workout, I do little spurts of a few minutes. It works for me and my family. My shoulders burn right now and it feels awesome. I did a minute plank! The last time I tried, I did a few seconds. I can tell how exercising in other ways is helping me with my arms. My arms are the worst. Arm exercises are the hardest for me to do. They hurt so bad and I want to give up. I can typically power through it if I hold my breath, which is bad lol. I will add more content as I continue my journey!
